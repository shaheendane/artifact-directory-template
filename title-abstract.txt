Title:
Sleep Stage Classification for Patients With Sleep Apnea

Abstract:
Sleeping is not uniform and consists of four stages: N1, N2, N3, and REM sleep. The analysis of sleep stages is essential for understanding and diagnosing sleep-related diseases, such as insomnia, narcolepsy, and sleep apnea; however, sleep stage classification often does not generalize to patients with sleep apnea. The goal of our project is to build a sleep stage classifier specifically for people with sleep apnea and understand how it differs from the normal sleep stage. We will then explore whether or not the inclusion and featurization of ECG data will improve the performance of our model.
